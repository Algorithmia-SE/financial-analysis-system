OKORO\\n(smiling)\\nOh, that? Just a few minor issues. We\\'re working on them.\\n\\nNNEOMA\\n(unconvinced)\\nI don\\'t believe you. You\\'re using us for your own gain, aren\\'t you?\\n\\nDR. OKORO\\n(angrily)\\nHow dare you! I\\'m trying to rebuild Nigeria\\'s economy, and you\\'re questioning my motives?\\n\\nNNEOMA\\n(firmly)\\nI\\'m not going to let you use us for your own gain. We\\'re going to take you down.\\n\\nCUT TO:\\n\\nEXT. SAFE HAVEN - DAY\\n\\nNneoma and her team launch a surprise attack on Dr. Okoro and his followers.
